# Text_To_Audio
This code is a GUI application that converts text to speech using the pyttsx3 library. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library. The main functionality of the application is implemented using the speaknow() function which takes the text entered in the text area and converts it to speech using the pyttsx3 library. The function uses the gender and speed selected in the GUI to adjust the voice properties.

The GUI consists of a top frame with the application name and logo. Below the top frame is a text area where users can enter the text they want to convert to speech. Below the text area are two combo boxes, one to select the gender of the voice and the other to select the speed of the voice. There is also a speak button that triggers the conversion of text to speech.
